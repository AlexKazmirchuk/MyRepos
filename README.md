# Completed test task 

## Out test assignment includes:

* Designing UI (it shouldn’t be too complex, but try and avoid making
mistakes)

* Working with API GitHub

## The assignment and requirements for its completion:

* The application design should include three screens

* a GitHub login page

* a list of user repositories

* one that allows searching through all GitHub repositories and
outputs the necessary search results.

* Each repository’s name and description should be included in list
items

* The code must be neat and clean

* You need to publish the completed assignment to either GitHub or
Bitbucket

## It’d be nice if you could also:

* give the application some custom style and add animations,
dialogues, etc.

We’ll focus most on checking the code, meaning that you should pay very
close attention to its clarity and accuracy.
